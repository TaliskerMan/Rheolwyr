It has been tested to\r\nvarious extents with Python 2.7 and 3.3 through 3.6.\r\n\r\nThe Python X Library will only work on systems that have an X server installed,\r\nsuch as most Linux distros, but will not work on Windows or MacOS.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThe Python Xlib uses the standard setuptools package, to install run\r\nthis command:\r\n\r\n::\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\nSee the command help for details: ``python setup.py install -h``.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can run programs from the distribution directory, or\r\nchange the module path in programs.\r\n\r\nThere's a simple example program, implemented twice using both the\r\nhigh-level interface and the low-level protocol.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThe Python X Library is intended to be a fully functional X client\r\nlibrary for Python programs. It is written entirely in Python, in\r\ncontrast to earlier X libraries for Python (the ancient X extension and\r\nthe newer plxlib) which were interfaces to the C Xlib.\r\n\r\nThis is possible to do since X client programs communicate with the X\r\nserver via the X protocol. The communication takes place over TCP/IP,\r\nUnix sockets, DECnet or any other streaming network protocol. The C Xlib\r\nis merely an interface to this protocol, providing functions suitable\r\nfor a C environment.\r\n\r\nThere are three advantages of implementing a pure Python library:\r\n\r\n-  Integration: The library can make use of the wonderful object system\r\n   in Python, providing an easy-to-use class hierarchy.\r\n\r\n-  Portability: The library will be usable on (almost) any computer\r\n   which have Python installed. A C interface could be problematic to\r\n   port to non-Unix systems, such as MS Windows or OpenVMS.\r\n\r\n-  Maintainability: It is much easier to develop and debug native Python\r\n   modules than modules written in C.\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThe reference manual is not finished by far, but is probably still useful. It\r\ncan be `browsed online <https://python-xlib.github.io/>`__.\r\n\r\nThere are also some `example programs <Examples_>`_ and, of course,\r\n`the standard X11 documentation <https://tronche.com/gui/x/xlib/>`__ applies.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject status\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nThe low-level protocol is complete, implementing client-side X11R6. The\r\nhigh-level object oriented interface is also fully functional. It is\r\npossible to write client applications with the library. Currently, the\r\nonly real application using Python Xlib is the window manager PLWM,\r\nstarting with version 2.0.\r\n\r\nThere is a resource database implementation, ICCCM support and a\r\nframework for adding X extension code. Several extensions have been\r\nimplemented (RECORD, SHAPE, Xinerama, Composite, RANDR, DAMAGE,\r\nGeneric Event, SECURITY, XFIXES, XInput, XTEST, NV-CONTROL, DPMS and XRes);\r\npatches for additions are very welcome.\r\n\r\nThere are most likely still bugs, but the library is at least stable\r\nenough to run PLWM. A continuously bigger part of the library is covered\r\nby regression tests, improving stability.\r\n\r\nThe documentation is still quite rudimentary, but should be of some help\r\nfor people programming with the Xlib. X beginners should first find some\r\ngeneral texts on X. A very good starting point is\r\nhttp://www.rahul.net/kenton/xsites.html\r\n\r\nSee the file TODO for a detailed list of what is missing, approximately\r\nordered by importance.\r\n\r\n.. _Homepage:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib\r\n.. _Releases:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/releases\r\n.. _Changelog:    https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/tree/master/CHANGELOG.md\r\n.. _Contributors: https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/graphs/contributors\r\n.. _Examples:     https://github.com/python-xlib/python-xlib/tree/master/examples\r\n\r\n.. |Build Status| image:: https://travis-ci.org/python-xlib/python-xlib.svg?branch=master\r\n   :target: https://travis-ci.org/python-xlib/python-xlib\r\n.. |codecov.io| image:: https://codecov.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/coverage.svg?branch=master\r\n   :target: https://codecov.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib?branch=master\r\n.. |Code Health| image:: https://landscape.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/master/landscape.svg?style=flat\r\n   :target: https://landscape.io/github/python-xlib/python-xlib/master\r\n\r\n\r\n",

This might be necessary when integrating with other GUI frameworks\nthat incorporate a main-loop, but when run from a script, this will cause the\nprogram to terminate immediately.\n\n\nThe mouse listener thread\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe listener callbacks are invoked directly from an operating thread on some\nplatforms, notably *Windows*.\n\nThis means that long running procedures and blocking operations should not be\ninvoked from the callback, as this risks freezing input for all processes.\n\nA possible workaround is to just dispatch incoming messages to a queue, and let\na separate thread handle them.\n\n\nHandling mouse listener errors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a callback handler raises an exception, the listener will be stopped. Since\ncallbacks run in a dedicated thread, the exceptions will not automatically be\nreraised.\n\nTo be notified about callback errors, call ``Thread.join`` on the listener\ninstance::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    class MyException(Exception): pass\n\n    def on_click(x, y, button, pressed):\n        if button == mouse.Button.left:\n            raise MyException(button)\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with mouse.Listener(\n            on_click=on_click) as listener:\n        try:\n            listener.join()\n        except MyException as e:\n            print('{} was clicked'.format(e.args[0]))\n\n\nToggling event listening for the mouse listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce ``pynput.mouse.Listener.stop`` has been called, the listener cannot be\nrestarted, since listeners are instances of ``threading.Thread``.\n\nIf your application requires toggling listening events, you must either add an\ninternal flag to ignore events when not required, or create a new listener when\nresuming listening.\n\n\nSynchronous event listening for the mouse listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo simplify scripting, synchronous event listening is supported through the\nutility class ``pynput.mouse.Events``. This class supports reading single\nevents in a non-blocking fashion, as well as iterating over all events.\n\nTo read a single event, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with mouse.Events() as events:\n        # Block at most one second\n        event = events.get(1.0)\n        if event is None:\n            print('You did not interact with the mouse within one second')\n        else:\n            print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nTo iterate over mouse events, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import mouse\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with mouse.Events() as events:\n        for event in events:\n            if event.button == mouse.Button.right:\n                break\n            else:\n                print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nPlease note that the iterator method does not support non-blocking operation,\nso it will wait for at least one mouse event.\n\nThe events will be instances of the inner classes found in\n``pynput.mouse.Events``.\n\n\nEnsuring consistent coordinates between listener and controller on Windows\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRecent versions of _Windows_ support running legacy applications scaled when\nthe system scaling has been increased beyond 100%. This allows old applications\nto scale, albeit with a blurry look, and avoids tiny, unusable user interfaces.\n\nThis scaling is unfortunately inconsistently applied to a mouse listener and a\ncontroller: the listener will receive physical coordinates, but the controller\nhas to work with scaled coordinates.\n\nThis can be worked around by telling Windows that your application is DPI\naware. This is a process global setting, so _pynput_ cannot do it\nautomatically. Do enable DPI awareness, run the following code::\n\n   import ctypes\n\n\n   PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE = 2\n\n   ctypes.windll.shcore.SetProcessDpiAwareness(PROCESS_PER_MONITOR_DPI_AWARE)\n\n\nControlling the keyboard\n------------------------\n\nUse ``pynput.keyboard.Controller`` like this::\n\n    from pynput.keyboard import Key, Controller\n\n    keyboard = Controller()\n\n    # Press and release space\n    keyboard.press(Key.space)\n    keyboard.release(Key.space)\n\n    # Type a lower case A; this will work even if no key on the\n    # physical keyboard is labelled 'A'\n    keyboard.press('a')\n    keyboard.release('a')\n\n    # Type two upper case As\n    keyboard.press('A')\n    keyboard.release('A')\n    with keyboard.pressed(Key.shift):\n        keyboard.press('a')\n        keyboard.release('a')\n\n    # Type 'Hello World' using the shortcut type method\n    keyboard.type('Hello World')\n\n\nMonitoring the keyboard\n-----------------------\n\nUse ``pynput.keyboard.Listener`` like this::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_press(key, injected):\n        try:\n            print('alphanumeric key {} pressed; it was {}'.format(\n                key.char, 'faked' if injected else 'not faked'))\n        except AttributeError:\n            print('special key {} pressed'.format(\n                key))\n\n    def on_release(key, injected):\n        print('{} released; it was {}'.format(\n            key, 'faked' if injected else 'not faked'))\n        if key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n            # Stop listener\n            return False\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=on_press,\n            on_release=on_release) as listener:\n        listener.join()\n\n    # ...or, in a non-blocking fashion:\n    listener = keyboard.Listener(\n        on_press=on_press,\n        on_release=on_release)\n    listener.start()\n\nA keyboard listener is a ``threading.Thread``, and all callbacks will be\ninvoked from the thread.\n\nCall ``pynput.keyboard.Listener.stop`` from anywhere, raise ``StopException``\nor return ``False`` from a callback to stop the listener.\n\nThe ``key`` parameter passed to callbacks is a ``pynput.keyboard.Key``, for\nspecial keys, a ``pynput.keyboard.KeyCode`` for normal alphanumeric keys, or\njust ``None`` for unknown keys.\n\nWhen using the non-blocking version above, the current thread will continue\nexecuting. This might be necessary when integrating with other GUI frameworks\nthat incorporate a main-loop, but when run from a script, this will cause the\nprogram to terminate immediately.\n\n\nThe keyboard listener thread\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe listener callbacks are invoked directly from an operating thread on some\nplatforms, notably *Windows*.\n\nThis means that long running procedures and blocking operations should not be\ninvoked from the callback, as this risks freezing input for all processes.\n\nA possible workaround is to just dispatch incoming messages to a queue, and let\na separate thread handle them.\n\n\nHandling keyboard listener errors\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nIf a callback handler raises an exception, the listener will be stopped. Since\ncallbacks run in a dedicated thread, the exceptions will not automatically be\nreraised.\n\nTo be notified about callback errors, call ``Thread.join`` on the listener\ninstance::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    class MyException(Exception): pass\n\n    def on_press(key):\n        if key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n            raise MyException(key)\n\n    # Collect events until released\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=on_press) as listener:\n        try:\n            listener.join()\n        except MyException as e:\n            print('{} was pressed'.format(e.args[0]))\n\n\nToggling event listening for the keyboard listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nOnce ``pynput.keyboard.Listener.stop`` has been called, the listener cannot be\nrestarted, since listeners are instances of ``threading.Thread``.\n\nIf your application requires toggling listening events, you must either add an\ninternal flag to ignore events when not required, or create a new listener when\nresuming listening.\n\n\nSynchronous event listening for the keyboard listener\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nTo simplify scripting, synchronous event listening is supported through the\nutility class ``pynput.keyboard.Events``. This class supports reading single\nevents in a non-blocking fashion, as well as iterating over all events.\n\nTo read a single event, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with keyboard.Events() as events:\n        # Block at most one second\n        event = events.get(1.0)\n        if event is None:\n            print('You did not press a key within one second')\n        else:\n            print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nTo iterate over keyboard events, use the following code::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    # The event listener will be running in this block\n    with keyboard.Events() as events:\n        for event in events:\n            if event.key == keyboard.Key.esc:\n                break\n            else:\n                print('Received event {}'.format(event))\n\nPlease note that the iterator method does not support non-blocking operation,\nso it will wait for at least one keyboard event.\n\nThe events will be instances of the inner classes found in\n``pynput.keyboard.Events``.\n\n\nGlobal hotkeys\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nA common use case for keyboard monitors is reacting to global hotkeys. Since a\nlistener does not maintain any state, hotkeys involving multiple keys must\nstore this state somewhere.\n\n*pynput* provides the class ``pynput.keyboard.HotKey`` for this purpose. It\ncontains two methods to update the state, designed to be easily interoperable\nwith a keyboard listener: ``pynput.keyboard.HotKey.press`` and\n``pynput.keyboard.HotKey.release`` which can be directly passed as listener\ncallbacks.\n\nThe intended usage is as follows::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_activate():\n        print('Global hotkey activated!')\n\n    def for_canonical(f):\n        return lambda k: f(l.canonical(k))\n\n    hotkey = keyboard.HotKey(\n        keyboard.HotKey.parse('<ctrl>+<alt>+h'),\n        on_activate)\n    with keyboard.Listener(\n            on_press=for_canonical(hotkey.press),\n            on_release=for_canonical(hotkey.release)) as l:\n        l.join()\n\nThis will create a hotkey, and then use a listener to update its state. Once\nall the specified keys are pressed simultaneously, ``on_activate`` will be\ninvoked.\n\nNote that keys are passed through ``pynput.keyboard.Listener.canonical`` before\nbeing passed to the ``HotKey`` instance. This is to remove any modifier state\nfrom the key events, and to normalise modifiers with more than one physical\nbutton.\n\nThe method ``pynput.keyboard.HotKey.parse`` is a convenience function to\ntransform shortcut strings to key collections. Please see its documentation for\nmore information.\n\nTo register a number of global hotkeys, use the convenience class\n``pynput.keyboard.GlobalHotKeys``::\n\n    from pynput import keyboard\n\n    def on_activate_h():\n        print('<ctrl>+<alt>+h pressed')\n\n    def on_activate_i():\n        print('<ctrl>+<alt>+i pressed')\n\n    with keyboard.GlobalHotKeys({\n            '<ctrl>+<alt>+h': on_activate_h,\n            '<ctrl>+<alt>+i': on_activate_i}) as h:\n        h.join()\n\n\nRelease Notes\n=============\n\nv1.8.1 (2025-03-17) - Various fixes\n-----------------------------------\n*  Remove incorrectly merged line for the *Xorg* backend.

By default, the `pasteboard` package is used.\n\n`pbcopy`/`pbpaste` can also be used as a backend, but does not support arbitrary binary data, which may lead to \ndata being lost on copy/paste. This backend may be removed in a future release.\n\n### Linux\n\nLinux on X11 requires `xclip` to work. Install with your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install xclip`\nLinux on Wayland requires `wl-clipboard` to work. Install with your package manager, e.g. `sudo apt install wl-clipboard`\n\n# Acknowledgements\n\nBig thanks to [Howard Mao](https://github.com/zhemao) for donating the PyClip project name on PyPI to \nthis project.\n",
